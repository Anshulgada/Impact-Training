# a = 10          # Could be any data type, except list, tuple and dictionary, 
# b = 10          # if a & b are same them id is same.
# print(id(a) == id(b))
# b=5
# print(id(a) == id(b))


# a1 = [1,2,3,4,5]        # Will be different ids
# b1 = [1,2,3,4,5]        # It also changes everytime we run it
# print(id(a1), " ", id(b1))

# print(5 << 3)           # Increases value
# # Formula for manually calc ==> a = a * (2^n) where a = 5, n = 3
#
# print(15 >> 3)           # Decreases value
# # Formula for manually calc ==> a = a // (2^n) where a = 15, n = 3 ==> Floor Division (Nearest decimal)
